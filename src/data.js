    info: `A group of anthropomorphic farm animals who rebel against their human farmer, hoping to create a society where the animals 
    can be equal, free, and happy. 
    
    Unlike other books which may be banned for several reasons, there's 
    really only one main reason that Animal Farm has ever been banned:  the critique of Communism. It should be noted that George Orwell, the author, was not a communist, nor was "Animal Farm"  communist propaganda. On the contrary, Orwell was a Democratic socialist, writing in 1946, 
   "Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or 
    indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it"`,

    info: `In an England of the future, Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his "Droogs" spend their nights getting high at the Korova Milkbar before embarking on "a little of the old ultraviolence," while jauntily warbling "Singin' in the Rain." After he's jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady to death, Alex submits to behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence. Returned to 
    the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims.
    
    Part of what made "A Clockwork Orange" a source of such intense controversy was the sexual violence in it.`,

    info: `The plot concerns a group of British boys who are stranded on an uninhabited island and their disastrous attempts to govern themselves. Themes include the tension between groupthink and individuality, between rational and emotional reactions, 
    and between morality and immorality.
    
    Bullying is rampant throughout the book— in fact, it is one of the main plot lines. Lord of the Flies by William Golding was challenged in the Waterloo Iowa schools in 1992 because of profanity, lurid passages about sex, and statements defamatory to 
    minorities, God, women, and the disabled.`,
